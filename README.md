I am trying to see what happens using the git tool
## initialize

remote to local :"git clone"
local to rempte : git init and git push
## git config --global user mail "kembaraphael@gmail.com"
this enable git to recognize the email address of the user who has made any change
## git config --global user name "raphael"
this enable git to recognize the user name of the user who has made any change

## workflow
1.gatherin modified files >: ' git add -all'[ it adds all the changes made in one shot]
2. Name the group of modification  . 'git commit -m "your description"
3.send to the cloud/remote repository : 'git push'
retrieve modificqwtion from the remote repository 'git pull'

Don't forget the ?git status' to keep track of the current state
