I am trying to see what happens using the git tool
## initialize

remote to local :git clone
local to rempte : git init and git push
## git config --global user mail "kembaraphael@gmail.com"
this enable git to recognize the email address of the user who has made any change
## git config --global user name "raphael"
this enable git to recognize the user name of the user who has made any change
